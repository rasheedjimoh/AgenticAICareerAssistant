# 🤖 Agentic AI Career Assistance (Portfolio Project)

## 🌟 Project Overview
I built and deployed an **Agentic AI Career Assistant** — a conversational AI agent that leverages my professional background, experiences, and portfolio context as its knowledge base.  

This isn’t a generic chatbot. Instead, it’s designed to:  
- Answer questions about my **career journey, skills, and projects**.  
- Provide structured insights into my **security engineering and AI work**.  
- Showcase how **Agentic AI patterns** can turn static career data into an interactive professional experience.  

The full project (documentation and access link to the chatbot) is available here, including the "How to Use" section below.
